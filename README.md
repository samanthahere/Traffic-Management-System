# Traffic-Management-System

The Traffic Management System is designed to make city traffic monitoring easier and more organized. It includes role-based profile management so different users, such as admins or officers, can access the right tools. The system supports route selection from start to end, maintains a complete vehicle and driver database, and provides an Incident Desk where users can report accidents or traffic issues. Officers can review these cases through the Incident Explorer, helping them understand traffic patterns and respond quickly. A Fine Ledger is also included to record and track fines, making enforcement transparent and efficient.
